          The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammals.
It is the only domesticated species in the Felidae family and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
A cat can be either an indoor cat, a farm cat or a wild cat; the latter extends freely and avoids human contact.
People appreciate domestic cats for their companionship and ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized in various cat registries.
The cat is anatomically similar to other cat species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to kill small prey. 
His night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Communicating with cats includes vocalizations such as mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and growling, as well as feline body language. 
The predator, which is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), is a solitary hunter but a social species.
It can hear sounds that are too faint or too high-frequency for the human ear, such as those of mice and other small mammals. Cats also secrete and sense pheromones.
